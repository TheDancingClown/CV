## Louis Kirkham

Having spent nearly 20 years working as an accountant while daydreaming about writing programs to automate my repetitive tasks, I made the career move in 2020 to an industry that closer aligns to my personal interests.

## Experience

#### Makers Academy 

I studied at Makers Academy from September 2020 - December 2020.

Makers Academy is a selective London based boot camp turning novices into hireable software developers. With a focus on learning skills over learning a specific programming language graduates are ideally equipped with an adaptability that is essential in the ever changing world we live in.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

More of a hobby than a skill, I constantly seek out problems to solve and thrive on the positive satisfaction from success. Cryptic crosswords, escape rooms, puzzle games and competitive board games are all regular exercises where I utilise and enjoy problem solving.

#### Professionalism

Working in a professional client facing environment for over 15 years I have demonstrated the following:

- Attention to detail - it was important to make sure the numbers go in the right order on a tax return
- Teamwork - working together to meet tough deadlines during tax season
- Communication - explaining to clients that the fact they have spent all their profit is not proof they do not earn enough to pay tax
- Management - running a small office when the owner decided to live in another country with better weather
- Training - feeding years of bad habits to impressionable newcomers

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2020 - November 2020)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### Irrelevant qualifications

## Hobbies

I like being active and swim regularly as well as playing league cricket and hockey.

I am learning to play drums with zero aspiration to be in a band.
